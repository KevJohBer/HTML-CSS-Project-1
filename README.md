# Sweetkeebz

Sweetkeebz is a website for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts. This website in particular is meant to be an informational page about an event that Sweetkeebz as a company is hosting. 

Users of this website will be able to find information about what time the event starts and ends, where it is being held and where you can spend your night if you are staying over a couple of days. Users will also be able to sign up with their own Sweetkeebz account in order to buy a ticket to the meetup.

## Testing

* Project is tested on multiple screen sizes to make sure it is responsive

* made sure all external links work as they are supposed to

## bugs

* The CSS file was not loading when I posted the website. I fixed this by removing an unexpected forward slash in the directory of the css file.

* The images in the project were not loading, I fixed this also by removing an unexpected forward slash on every image directory.


## Validator Testing

* HTML 

    The HTML file passes all tests except for 1, it does not want to leave the action field empty but there is no directory for the data input to go.

* CSS 

    The CSS is still not tested as it does not load when i post it.

* Accessibility

    Used lighthouse to make sure the site it readable and accessible
